SourceMod.js
============
*Note: To compile this project, you need to put it in a /projects/smjs directory, with the /sourcemod-central, /hl2sdk-dota and /mmsource-1.9 folders with it. There is some stuff that needs to be changed in the project settings too (some hard coded paths, like output dir)*
